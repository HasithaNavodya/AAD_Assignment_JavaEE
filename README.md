# Java EE Project

Welcome to our Java EE project! This project exemplifies a sophisticated application structure, meticulously crafted to showcase a comprehensive division between its front-end and back-end components. Crafted with pedagogical intent, this project stands as an invaluable educational asset, offering a deep dive into the intricacies of Java EE development.

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a full-stack Java EE application, encompassing both the front-end and back-end components. It utilizes modern web development technologies to provide a seamless user experience while showcasing best practices in Java EE development.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main components:

### 1. Back-end

The back-end component of the project is responsible for handling server-side operations. It includes functionalities such as data processing, business logic implementation, and interaction with the underlying database. Key technologies utilized in the back-end include:

- Java EE: Provides a comprehensive suite of tools and frameworks for enterprise-level development.
- Apache Tomcat: Serves as the hosting platform for executing Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP).

The back-end code is organized following best practices and maintainability standards. Important directories and files include:

- `src/main/java`: Directory containing Java classes.
- `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/`: Configuration files for the Java EE application.

### 2. Front-end

The front-end component of the project focuses on delivering a user-friendly interface and seamless interaction with underlying functionalities. It utilizes HTML, CSS, jQuery, and AJAX to create dynamic and responsive web pages. Key technologies utilized in the front-end include:

- HTML: Provides the foundational structure for presenting information.
- CSS: Enhances aesthetics and design, adding style and visual appeal to the interface.
- jQuery: Facilitates dynamic client-side scripting, empowering interactivity and manipulation of HTML elements.
- AJAX: Enables asynchronous communication with the server, enhancing responsiveness and user experience.

The front-end code is organized in a structured manner to ensure clarity and maintainability. Important directories and files include:

- `index.html`: The main entry point for the web application.
- `controllers/`: Directory for JavaScript files, including jQuery and AJAX functionality.
- `assets/`: Directory for other resources used in the application, such as Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and jQuery.
